    "welcome_info_3": "In the 'Files' section, a patched client and an updater are already available. You can log into the server now, but it’s not fully configured yet, and there may be delays since the current host is somewhat weak.",
    "welcome_info_4": "The server has only one enthusiastic developer. There will be NO donations on the server. In the future, there might be a paid subscription, but that’s not under discussion for now.",

If you’ve downloaded the client or updater and they were blocked by antivirus, you should retrieve them from quarantine and create an exception. Also, keep in mind that antivirus or firewall may block files during the download process, resulting in corrupted files in the archive. In case of strange client behavior, it’s recommended to re-download the client or updater.",
    "files_text_2": "Also, the updater may show an 'Error unpacking updater.exe' message. At this stage, it’s not a big deal and doesn’t affect anything; the latest game client will still be downloaded to the updater’s folder.",
